<p>And I was under the 3rd one. During my childhood I was very hyperactive to the fact that I get spanked a lot by my father and angered all of the ones
    that know me. But now with God's mercy I am able to control my hyperactiveness but one still remains... <strong>MY INATTENTIVENESS!</strong>. 
    When I try to focus my mind always wanders and a lot of ideas are running in my mind,for example in a class. Most of the time I was misunderstood as
    a grumpy person because when I try to focus on a lecture or lesson I looked angry ðŸ˜…. Having ADHD is not the absent of focus but rather trouble
    maintaining focus and our Executive Function are poorly regulated. ADHD brains are low on dopamine or happy hormones so we are in search for activities that gave us dopamine, so it's hard for me to do task 
    that I don't have the interest in no matter how much focused we give in the end it does'nt matter, this results to late submissions, low grades, overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>To a neurotyoical person this may look like I procrastinating, but in the truth I'm not. I saying this not to justify my shortcomings but to explain, 
    to inform other people about the effects of having ADHD.     
</p>
    
<p>From what I've said it may look like that having <em>ADHD</em> is always negative etc.. But there are some good side effects having this. Remember what I've said that we are
    dopamine-seeker brain? 1 good thing having ADHD is to able to hyperfocus. I can hyperfocus to a certain activity for hours, I started my Study With Me Livestream on youtube 
    one reason is that to practice hyperfocusing on the necessary tasks.
